Hello, and welcome to the Adventure Map peripheral. If this is your first time downloading the source code, I would suggest that you read this carefully. First off I would like to state that I am NOT a shining example of how to code correctly in Java. I am still learning, and my code looks anything but neat. Additionally, if you download this peripheral, add it to your Minecraft game, and find that it breaks your world for some reason, I take no responsibility for that. I will always test this peripheral in a vanilla environment (with the exception of Forge and ComputerCraft), and therefore any damage that may ensue from running this peripheral with an incompatible mod is not my issue. Of course, if you do run into issues, I will be glad to take a look at them to see what I can do to fix them, but do not assume that I will put it #1 on my priority list. Another thing to note about this peripheral is that I give you the right to download, modify, and distribute in any way you see fit, although I do not condone any illegal activity through this project. Thank you for reading, Challenge.Accepted.
